# Denison Expanding Archives Omeka Theme

This repository is forked from Denison University's Expanding Archives Omeka theme. Within this repository is a customized version of the theme used for the Consolidated Klien digital art history project (http://consolidatedklien.com/). 

Primary changes made include an altered color scheme and new layouts and labels for the Item level view.

The theme is written in PHP, HTML, and CSS.
